There are many fruits that I have eaten, and among them is a fruit called mango which itself has got lot of varities. 

Among all those mango kinds, the one with rich an unique taste is called Sindhri mango. You've got to taste it to believe it. 

Eating this mangoes is also an art in itself. Some remove the skin before eating, remove the skin and cut it into slices, some cut it further into cubes, some keep the skin and cut it into slices, etc.
